# Expfactory Library

This is the library of official experiments provided by the Experiment Factory. Adding experiments to the core expfactory family is a process centered around pull requests (PRs), one of them being to this repository. Before contributing an experiment, the following questions are important to consider:

 - is this experiment generally useful to the larger community? For example, a new task would be useful, but a slightly modified stroop would be better served from your own repository.
 - Once you experiment is added to the library, you as the author are responsible for keeping it up to date and responding to issues, of course with help from our team. Updates will follow the same process.

Ready to get started? The [documentation](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory) base will walk you through the steps.
