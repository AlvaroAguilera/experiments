            <p>Welcome to the Space Adventure game! </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Today you will have the opportunity to take part in a journey through space.</p>
            <p>On your journey, you will be controlling a spaceship and visiting different planetary systems</p>
            <p>with the goal of collecting as many points as possible.</p><br>
            <p><strong>The more points you collect, the more money you will get for your participation!</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Before you start, the following tutorial will teach you everything you need to play the Space Adventure game,</p>
            <p>such as how to move the spaceship, how the planetary systems work and other game rules.</p>

            <p>In each game trial you will visit a new planetary system.</p><br><br>

            <p>You just learned how to to navigate to different planets.</p><br>
            <p>You will now learn that landing on a planet can sometimes be affected by cosmic conditions.</p><br>
            <p>On most planets in a planetary system the landing conditions are ideal.</p>
            <p>So, your spaceship will be able to land reliably on the target planet you are heading for.</p><br>
            <p>However, in every planetary system there is also one planet that is surrounded by an asteroid storm.</p>
            <p>You can always see clearly see which planet is affected. An example is shown on the next instruction screen.</p><br><br>

        </div>
    
        <div id="jump-uncertainty-2" class="text-aligned inactive">
            <p>Landing on this planet is more difficult because of the asteroid storm.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the rocket might sometimes miss the target planet</p>
            <p>and instead land on one of the two directly adjacent planets.</p><br>
            <p>So, if you try and go to a planet with asteroids, please remember</p>
            <p>that you will not always reach the location you planned to go to.</p><br><br>

            <p>Here you see an example of where the rocket might land if you go forward</p>
            <p>one step (picture to the left) or two steps (picture to the right) in order to reach a planet with asteroids.</p><br>
            <p>The solid arrows show the target planet and</p>

            <p>To give you a feel for how reliable landing in an asteroid storm is, you can try this out a few times in the next instruction screen,</p>
            <p>where you have to repeatedly go forward one or two step in order to reach the planet with the asteroids.</p><br><br>

            <p>Be aware that the chance of missing the target planet in an asteroid storm does not change throughout the game.</p>

            <p>One last thing you need to know:</p>
            <p>In each new planetary system you can travel to 3 planets and you have to try to collect as much points as possible on the journey.</p> 
            <p>The number of green squares in the centre of the screen shows you how many planets you can still visit before moving to a new planetary system.</p>

            <p>To summarize:</p><br>
            <p>Your task is to collect as many points as possible by travelling from planet to planet.</p>
            <p>You can travel either one (M-key) or two steps (X-key) in the clockwise direction.</p>
            <p>Different planet types can bring or make you lose points.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The bar at the top of the screen shows you how many points you currently have.</p>
            <p>In each planetary system, there is one planet that is surrounded by an asteroid storm</p>
            <p>which makes landing on that planet more difficult.</p>
            <p>This can sometimes cause you to land on one of its neighbouring planets instead of the target planet.</p><br>

        <div id="tip-1" class="text-aligned inactive">
            <p>One important tip:</p>
            <p>It will help you a lot in the task if you plan all 3 of your travel steps in advance.</p>
            <p>Example: Imagine you start in the planet constellation given below. </p>

            <div><img class="img-instr-small" src="src/Tipp_1.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>If you plan only two moves in advance, you would move forward one step to the +20 planet and then</p>
            <p>move two steps forward to the +10 planet. However, then you would be forced to travel to one of the red planets (-20) and in total earn only 10 points.</p><br>
            <p>Please press the right arrow key to continue or the left arrow key to go back one page.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="tip-2" class="text-aligned inactive">


            <p>So, in this planetary system it would have been better to lose a smaller amount of points first </p>
            <p>by going one step to the -10 planet and then travel to the +10 planet.</p>

            <img class="img-instr-small" src="src/Tipp_2.png" alt="" class="img-instr">
            <p>In total you would have gained 20 points by doing this.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="intro-practice-start" class="text-aligned inactive">
            <p>You will now practice a whole game trial.</p>
            <p>Please plan your 3 travel steps in advance so that you get as many points as possible but</p>
            <p>do not enter new travelling commands while the rocket is still moving.</p>
            <p>The rocket has to land first before you can input your next action.</p><br>
            <p>You can always take as much time as you need to plan your journey.</p><br>
            <p>There is no asteroid storm in these sample runs for simplicity. </p>
